# Assignment 1: Git 
Siete y Medio (Seven and a Half) is a casino game similar to Blackjack. The objective of the game is to obtain a hand of cards with the closest value to 7.5, without crossing 7.5. In this program, the user plays against the dealer (the computer) until the player runs out of money or wins $1000. A text file, gamelog.txt, is also created in the program, which tracks the history of the game. The file tracks the cards in the player and dealer hands for each round, including how much money the player bet for the round.
